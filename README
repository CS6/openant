openant
==============================================================================

Features
==============================================================================

 - ANT
 - ANT-FS (with command pipe, file listings, downloading, uploading, etc)
 - Three libs (ant.base basic ANT library, ant.easy blocking version using 
   ant.base, ant.fs ANT-FS library)

Requirements
==============================================================================

- Python 2.7+

- PyUSB 1.0 (seems to be a bug which makes it segfaults on version before
  Alpha 2). It is recommended to use pip to install PyUSB:
  
  pip install pyusb

  Alternatively you can install it from GitHub:

  https://github.com/walac/pyusb

- Install udev rules (recommended). This is only needed if you want to avoid
  running the program as root. Install with:

  sudo cp resources/ant-usbstick2.rules /etc/udev/rules.d

Supported devices
==============================================================================

Any compliant ANT-FS device should in theory work. Users of these device have
been able to download data of their watches:

 - Garmin Forerunner 60
 - Garmin Forerunner 405CX
 - Garmin Forerunner 310XT
 - Garmin Forerunner 610
 - Garmin Forerunner 910XT
 - Garmin FR70
 - Garmin Swim

It's possible that other manufactures using ANT+/ANT-FS, such as Suunto and
Timex might work, but have *never* been tested as far as I know. Please let
me know if you have any success with devices that are not listed here.

The following USB sticks are known to work:

 - ANT USBStick2 (0fcf:1008 Dynastream Innovations, Inc.)
 - ANT USBStick3 (0fcf:1009 Dynastream Innovations, Inc.)
