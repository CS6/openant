openant
==============================================================================

Features
==============================================================================

 - ANT
 - ANT-FS (with command pipe, file listings, downloading, uploading, etc)
 - Three libs (ant.base basic ANT library, ant.easy blocking version using 
   ant.base, ant.fs ANT-FS library)

Installing
==============================================================================

Automatic install:

Install openant by typing `python setup.py install`. You need to be root this
as root, so either run with `sudo` or `su` first.

Doing this will install requried libs, openant in the correct place, and 
install the udev rules.


Requirements
==============================================================================

- Python 2.7+

These should only be necessary to install manually if you are not using the
setup.py installation script:

- PyUSB 1.0 (seems to be a bug which makes it segfaults on version before
  Alpha 2). It is recommended to use pip to install PyUSB:
  
  pip install pyusb

  Alternatively you can install it from GitHub:

  https://github.com/walac/pyusb

- Install udev rules (recommended). This is only needed if you want to avoid
  running the program as root. Install with:

  sudo cp resources/ant-usbstick2.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
